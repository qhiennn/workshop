**Backup and Disaster Recovery Automation for Multi-Database Environment** is a solution that automates the backup and restoration processes for various types of databases on AWS, such as **Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and DocumentDB**.  
This solution ensures that data is always available, minimizes the risk of loss, and meets the requirements for **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** and **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**.

### Key Benefits:
- **Automates** the entire periodic backup process.
- **Tests recovery capabilities** to ensure backups are functional.
- **Sends alerts** in case of backup or restoration failures.
- **Secures data** through encryption and IAM access control.
- **Centralized monitoring** via CloudWatch and AWS Config.
- **Scalable** to support multi-region Disaster Recovery in the future.

With this approach, the system is not only suitable for real production environments but also helps save operational time and costs while ensuring data safety for the **Hutech Event Ticket Booking Website**.
